TODO:
    1. unreused_prob.py needed to be further assured (method to determine prob calculation)
    2. SSPM's reuse rule should be further modified according to paper to avoid ambiguity
    3. Setting of SPM needed to be further assured, and how to reduce training cost
    4. calculate the coding sequence without considering the length code (first one in the seed sequence)?
    5. head_tail rule is supposed to be coded with the seperate of head and tail (or first head then tail)?
    6. sspm needs to be enlagred (train on not only pastebin, leads to unbalance when choosing among spm and sspm
	sspm may be first trained on rockyou set and then on pastebin
    7. randomness is not achived
    8. the python package needed to be aligned
    9. could set a password length table (according to trainset) for encoding of spm, which could be more convincing!


Debug vault:
    vault_t = Vault('beeno', '123456')
    vault_t.init_vault()
    vault_t.get_pw()
    vault_t.add_pw()
        case1 => existed domain
        case2 => unexisted domain
